In JavaScript, there are several data types:

Primitive data types:

String: Represents textual data, e.g., "hello".
Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., 5, 3.14.
Boolean: Represents true or false.
Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value, denoted by null.
Undefined: Denotes a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It's denoted by undefined.
Symbol (added in ECMAScript 6): Represents a unique identifier.
Non-primitive data types (also known as reference types):

Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, e.g., { key: value }.
Array: A special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable, e.g., [1, 2, 3].
Function: A callable object, e.g., function myFunction() { // code }.
Date: Represents a date and time, e.g., new Date().
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type without any type enforcement.
